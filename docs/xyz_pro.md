## Schema Validation

Apply a schema validation json file to space

The schema definition can be in the form of a web address or a local schema json file.

!!! note "Schema validation is not transactional (yet)"
    The schema validation will be non transactional (Transaction = FALSE) i.e. upload all the objects which passes schema definition and display the list of objects rejected.
